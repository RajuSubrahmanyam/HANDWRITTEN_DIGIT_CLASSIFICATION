# Handwritten Digit Classification Using CNN

This repository contains a project that implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates how CNNs can effectively recognize and classify handwritten numbers with high accuracy.



The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset in machine learning and deep learning, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9). This project uses a CNN model to classify the digits and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the dataset.

 Features
- Implementation of a CNN architecture tailored for digit classification.
- Preprocessing pipeline for the MNIST dataset.
- Training and evaluation scripts with metrics visualization.
- Saved model checkpoint for quick inference.


The MNIST dataset can be downloaded directly from the TensorFlow/Keras library. No additional setup is required.



 Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- TensorFlow 2.9 or above

 Results
The project achieved the following results on the MNIST dataset:
- **Training Accuracy:** 99.07%
- **Test Accuracy:** 98.30%
